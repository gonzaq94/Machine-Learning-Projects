<h1>Machine Learning mini projects</h1>

This repository contains simple implementations, experiments and explanations for understanding several machine learning algorithms.

- Neural networks
- CNNs and activation maps
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- Clustering
- Kernel methods (Kernel regression, KNN)
- Statistical Hypothesis Test

It also contains a ML mini project, were several algorithms (SVM,KNN,Neural Network,Decision Tree, Bayes Classifier) were implemented for classification tasks in the kidney disease and Boston bank note datasets. These codes were done for the UE Machine Learning of IMT-Atlantique.
